    <h1>Understanding the Korean Alphabet (Hangul)</h1>
    <p>
      The Korean alphabet, known as Hangul (한글), is a unique writing system
      created in the 15th century by King Sejong the Great. It was designed to
      be easy to learn and use, with each character representing a single
      sound. This makes Hangul one of the most phonetic writing systems in the
      world.
    </p>

    <h2>History of Hangul</h2>
    <p>
      Hangeul was created during the Joseon Dynasty in 1443 and was officially
      promulgated in 1446. King Sejong sought to create an alphabet that would
      allow the common people to read and write easily, regardless of their
      social status or education level. Hangul was revolutionary because it
      was the first writing system to represent the sounds of spoken Korean.
    </p>

    <h2>Structure of Hangul</h2>
    <p>
      Hangul characters are composed of individual letters called jamo (자모).
      There are 14 basic consonants and 10 basic vowels, which can be combined
      to form syllabic blocks. Each syllabic block represents a single
      syllable of Korean speech.

    <h2>Forming Syllables</h2>
    <p>
      In Hangul, syllables are formed by combining consonants and vowels into
      a block-like structure. Each syllable consists of an initial consonant
      (optional), a medial vowel, and a final consonant (optional). Here are
      some examples:
